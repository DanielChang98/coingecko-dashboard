## Deployed on Vercel

This application was built using Next.js.  
Check out the website here -> https://cryptocurrency-dashboard.vercel.app/

## How it works
1. The application will first display a `homepage`.
2. The `dashboard` will be shown once you click "Go to dashboard".
3. The table starts off empty. **Pick a currency**.
4. The table will then be populated with table rows.
5. You can favourite and unfavourite the cryptocurrency.
6. `Favourite` page will show the cryptocurrency that you have liked. However, you have to choose the currency first.
